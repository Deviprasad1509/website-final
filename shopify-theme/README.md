## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ **Liquid Error: 'header' is not a valid section type**

**Solution:** The theme uses `{% include %}` for header/footer (snippets), not `{% section %}`

**Problem:** Files not uploaded to correct locations
**Solution:** Ensure files are uploaded to:
- `assets/theme.css` → Assets folder
- `assets/theme.js` → Assets folder
- `snippets/header.liquid` → Snippets folder
- `snippets/footer.liquid` → Snippets folder

#### ❌ **Missing Navigation/Menu**
**Problem:** Navigation menus not set up in Shopify admin
**Solution:** Create navigation menus in **Online Store** → **Navigation**

#### ❌ **Products Not Displaying**
**Problem:** Products not assigned to collections
**Solution:** Add products to collections in product admin

#### ❌ **Theme Settings Not Working**
**Problem:** Settings schema not loaded
**Solution:** Re-upload `config/settings_schema.json` and refresh theme customizer

#### ❌ **Mobile Menu Not Working**
